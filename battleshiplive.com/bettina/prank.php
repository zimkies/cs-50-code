<? $message = " Dear Quincy,

Though I am not your eco-rep, I feel it is very important to limit our water waste.  I've taken several steps to reduce, nay, eliminate mine, and we should all follow my lead.

First, I have stopped washing my sheets.  Why bother?  I like my musk, and I get to steep myself in it every night.

Also, I no longer shower.  That doesn't do much because I'm quite short so there isn't much of me to clean.  Instead, I jump into the Charles, grab the mud at the bottom and use that as soap.  I once heard that you're supposed to wash the mud off afterward, but that's overrated. 

Penguins, take ownership of the environment!  If not, I will find you and roll all over your clothes.

Sincerely,
Asa Schachar. ";
