The point of the game of battleship is to sink all of your opponent’s ships.  Your opponent’s boats are hidden, and it is up to you to uncover where they are.  When a boat is sunk, the image turns from green to red.  Misses are represented by white circles, and hits are represented by red circles, reminiscent of the red and white pegs in the actual board games.  Once all of a player’s ships are destroyed, the game displays either the win screen or the lose screen.
