(Jesper, Björn) Stood there leaning to the city moon, casting silhouettes tall to grip her white rooms the black-clad voyeur in his black-clad masque in the serpentine sun of tragedy basked Stood there cursing at the soul-dead mass with their fabled illusions, the vain dreams that passed splinters of a life rushing by in the whirl a lone, silent warrior in a fantasy world He cried for night / but bnight could not come so, swept in the shroud of Misanthropia he went away and fed the empty galleries with the artifacts of the black rain sunken into the shadows with a dry, sardonic smile He made the footprints a part of his heart to rouse a sacred confrontation Stood there carving on the monument to lies digging of the earth, making friends with the soil as the all-mother rises and bares her bleeding thighs he disappears into her cold, icy womb.
Call me by my astral name Breeding fear through wordless tongue Heavenly thirst - unspeakable pain Emptied from all human motion Confront the faceless wrath  Beckoning silent from a sphere behind space Through twisted ruins of uncompleted dreams Sights of towers reaching for the moon Clawing at the skies - they gonna pull it down  Intensity - I feel the lava rushing through my veins Stars are reforming - to enter the fourth dimension  Beyond all galaxies Through timeless aeons of frost Unearthly hunger - angels descent  We are entering dimensions behind space
Reach for your razor Cut through the dawn See through your inner wrath Keys shan't open the doors  Behold my heart has stopped My lungs are laid in the final rest And still I see and do I feel Yes, but to earthly eyes I am gone To the land where legends never die Take me to the twilight land tonight  Again and again and again in every night The darkness climbs through my walls Ever screaming silent to the corrupted ears  Never to any man I will spear My speech it has no value Eyes that have seen the sights Bleed through the ages eternal  I ask no more A life has just begun Never will I see the sun And do I miss it No, my eyes are black Emotions fled through eyelids closed Throne of thorns Clad in shadows
I'll take you on a ride as a part-owner to my pain our ideals they collide coerced coexistence  I fought the world today - postpone my birth again we stumble on and one - but bound to die alone  pine - I'm selling my soul today pine - I need some sympathy  this infiltrates my brain in the sunshine the sun is mine pitiless wanderer close your eyes and bow your head grotesque thoughts in a line threw my wings ånto the blazing sun smile stretched on old trees eternal Brining jester masque  don't hurt a fly they all sing we're just ants in a great big play commercialize-infect-annihilate-progress visualize-inhale-pretend-betray
in your world, the day is no threat in my world, there is an absence of light genetic superior cell controlled by the fathomless and unbearable  a radical new Form of plastic and rage biologically optimized but with a strangling pulse  in your world, you find me worthy in my world, I parashoot my life a virtual drugstore populated by the fathomless and unbearable  machine, meat and blood in an intimate relationship the new - superior - more effective than all the preceding  when we can no longer cry and reality is torn then it's easy to forget that the responsibility lies on us all  in your world, the night is no threat in my world, the darkness transforms to a vision of hell populated by fathomless and unbearable
(Glenn, Jesper) I bid you welcome to my world They call me existence You have just entered through the gate to your journey towards eternity This part I control In the beggining you'll feel nothing As I climb beside you Time will be your master in this laborious part of human subsistence This part I control Black clouds embraces your soul Slowly passing through repeating lacunas of anguish When time takes your life I will transfer you into the bare grip of thinking tranquillity Voices frilling the emptiness of the dead floating Seamless across the surface into chilling stillness Nothing can help you now You'll never be lone again You'll never die again You'll never be born again You'll forever be, stuck here in eternity
To slit the grinning wounds from childhood's Seven Moons The palette stained with the ejaculated passions (of forbidden, hedonistic colours)  Strike from the omnipotence; all-seer all-deemer And haunt my severed county with your dripping secret games  You picked the unripe lilies Deflored and peeled the bleeding petals made known to me The grainy stains, the crimson lotus of the Black-Ash Inheritance The semen feed of gods and masters The worms still in me, still a part of me Racing out from leaking rooms Swoop from broken lungs to block the transmission To put an end to the nomad years  Father, you are the dead god in me
Towards the rich archaic heavens Towards the lack diorama You are the artist and the texture That plays with mantle of the earth  When the bleakest of powders Lie rooted to the starched stones And the roots that feed the peaking trees embrace the sleeping shores  Archaic pearls of sleep and death The voice of December losing its breath And the floweryard of white and grey is haunted  White as the down of flaking snow The heroic emblems of life  Green is the colour of my death As in winter-guise I swoop towards the ground Green is the landscape of my sorrowfilled passing  We Are In Flames Towards the dead archaic heavens We Are The Mantle and The Texture The alters the mantle of the earth
I demand nothing, but I want it all what privilege do we have under the sun, that gives us the right to the throne?  species come and go, but the earth stands forever fast all river runs towards the sea, but the sea is never full  to discover the loneliness and be to proud to show the wounds will forever wander alone through the years  but I won't let you near begging for you to understand the fear that lives in my soul which is an untouched spring  read, what is written on the silent mouth what is written in the soul for which is written in the shining silence we all have to read  my body will be bent from the burdens when the shaking floor of life-force reveal its chasm underneath if only one could be two steps ahead
Welcome here, the squirrel-wheel begins fasten the left hand belts Remember not to think too much and your trip will be numbingly pleasant  Non-caring is the easiest way but to secure a passage to the second plane you have to complete level one Their dead-smile lips turn on their TV while urban gravestones scrape the skies Rising over marionette cities and marionette skies  This is episode 666 destination chaos Each and all an actor blind
Lights are dim My tearful windows Through which no emotions pass Starvation of senses claws my soul  Answer me Are these walls my only shelter From the bleeding atmosphere Take me from these lands  I deliver thee from this agony A storm to cleanse thee  Mine is the right to be Malestorm of the everlost This is the curse of...  All is dark All but one aspect of life To be shackled In a shell, so misleading  These are the shells bestowed upon me Pass into the darkened of the midnight Sounds, faceless lights  Hands tear apart Dissolve possess You alone can take my soul Take flight
Through seven songs of rejoice His name relives his solar voice  Falling into the unknown Yet he shall feel no harm  Lights shine upon his face Night exists no longer  In unknown colours they confront him In soundless tongue they speak his name Moonred - reaching for life through eternity Starblack - the brooding silence is frightening me  One elderly custom in timeless guise In ceremonies of old one, dove now flies Fly through time
Originally performed by Depeche Mode  The handshake Seals a contract From the contract There's no turning back The turning point Of a career In Korea being insincere  The holiday Was fun packed The contract: Still intact  The grabbing hands Grab all they can All for themselves After all  It's a competitive world Everything counts in large amounts  The graph On the wall Tells the story Of it all Picture it now See just how The lies and deceit gained a little more power  Confidence taken in By a sun tan And a grin  The grabbing hands Grab all they can All for themselves After all  It's a competitive world Everything counts in large amounts  The grabbing hands Grab all they can Everything counts in large amounts
Shame marries the guilt introduces itself to the concept of total loneliness Sensations repressed make friends with Suicidia and here the leeches begin to suck away the lust for life  Thus Escape takes lead into a world unknown uncontrolled by all where border are erased and potential infinite Chosen cells glands and transmittors blast the body with joy Astral feet running up to dimension covered with gold stairs of glowing ectoplasma safir onyx and buzzing vibrations A dead man banquet food for the gods  There's only 1 real world our earth is but a shadow Created from a child's heart a living jewel from now on abode for a soul in its setting  Now sutting the bloodline re-tie the bleeding roots to a heavenly ship of glass and let it drift in passive arrogance in a one-word dialogue with the stars
(Jesper, Glenn) Mankind - proud conqueror and king swings its flag of primal glory to the winds Titans of the power-myth that failed Neanderthal hunger for the flash of war so frail So weak, so hollow-minded the primat flock responds the jester race submits For each day of war is a failure for man, enslaved to her mordial genes Illusions bleed from their fetid cores, bent to their rotten extremes We, the plague of Terra Firma, nature,s grand and last mistake plant the poisoned seed of cancer, set the severed fruits awake Burning like frozen relics in god's archaic graveland Burn the visionaire Kill the ideologies Mankind Must Die The doves and the angels return to their graves with flames on their pestilent wings while mushroom-clouds haunt their virginwhite skies to rape their utopian dreams Living the last days of evolution's end from the nest of humanity, the graveland vultures rend
Geology is digging through my brain a manta engulfing the world to throw it up once again to a guild of a lifted dagger  Neo-wolf but older again than the Lupus itself linked its fur to the gyroscope of time a collection of failures  A diabolical sequences of stabs written in cunning stone from the fossilised of thieves our lives dies  I see the nursing all-mother spitting out a trail of termites in the mouth of her first-born hope breast ripe with smog-filled rebellion  Apathy dressed in violence white insectoid legs curse her lips and mouth receptive only to pain
Behold the heart of mine in flames A top the highest mountain Below the darkest depths In the valley of hate I wander My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice  Trampled in fury by hordes of the light I am crushed by the hand of my sky My sky has forsaken me  Rivers of crimson lead me now Trail of fire In a place of fire eternal Left in flames  Scattered in a world of thorns Torn from my earthly self Aggrieved in tears and bitterness I fall beyond stars, beyond stars  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice Trampled in fury by hordes of the light My fiery heart is stronger than ever It's stronger than ever before  My heart in flames

Cre-age-aeon new beginning held in infinite vacuum Biotronic test-world free of inscription devoid of the echoes of man noble savage cyborg  In the cold ceremonial perfection more radiant than the sum of suns with each and every attribute of animal machine and man  Dystopia ElectroHeart the grotesque and the linear took one final giant blow into the Ram of what is us  Installing awaiting the restoration of unsequenced chaos  We've only seen the outlines of the beggining and this core the slowly moving raptor will make the very notion of Hell seem celestial in comparison
I often dream of huge numb buildings jet-black sinister architecture being installed when nobody sees Their appearance so sudden that few would take notice  And when I wake up I imagine being crushed by one imaginating it's weight it's silence and the absence of excuses for a havoced life and the priviledge of a 22-kilometers tombstone  Jotun  A body of black that carried no reflection defying it's own room un-earthly egg of decreation  There would be colonies mushroom-scattered forever out of content rising spores from a dying world to pollute and chase away what's left  Sun-white pulverised desert stone and serpentine lizard mouths Pales away the pyramids rewriting 4500 years of history raping the statue of liberty outplays the acropolis inverting the fjords invades the... skyline to dream its own existence in one single final word  Jotun  Can we identify them as the flint buried in our reptile skulls or the time-bomb coded in our dna
(Burok, Jesper, Glenn) I lie in your soothing arms, lord Hypnos your garment alive with your song I lie in your soothing arms, lord Hypnos Steep the spiral to your far abode in the wake of slumber, on visions I rode and fell like history through the chasm of ages into the charged, forbidden zones [journeys] How I have searched through a million worlds and faces yet unaware, I have not found my own true face, traceless and profound So, find me in these grandiose halls whwre long ago summers eternally fall and tune the strings of truthful longing to the frozen music of gods [journeys] Hypnagonia's lucid horizons play with the yearning I've quelled as I strike towards the Pantheon and what therein is held
For there is a purpose and reason Beyond all human apprehension The shrieking silence in the blackness of space  For there is a knowledge more complex Than life in this planet A knowledge in lune with the progress of stars  Lunar strain  All across the milky way Life suffers defeat Life that once was treasured  What once was nothing Has blossomed into form Once it was I that was nothing But now they say I will die  All across the galaxy Life suffers defeat Lunar strain  From nothingness to reality As we see it From nothingness to life My dismal tears of anguish Bleed into one with the songs of my heaven Loneliness is pain  Emptiness his power, loneliness his pain Serenity his might Yet we shall be honoured in the starforsaken night  Astral strain All around my silent moon Life suffers defeat  Astral strain
(Jesper) Tried of dull ages, I walk the same ground, collecting the tragedies still Hollow ambitions in a hollow mind carried my cross to the hill And how I lust for the dance and the fire deep of the nectarine sunset to drink spill me the wind and its fire to steal of the colours - I'm the moonshield Shattered hope became my guide and grief and pain my friends a brother pact in blood-ink penned declared my silent end Naked and dying under worlds of silent stone reaching for the moonshield that once upon us shone.
Detonation Fireworks and alchemy Genes spliced and triggered into the future and her organic cave  Seismorgasmic omnipotence scenes of magma in my eyes Eruption stones my system  I owe this to the animal inside and the stiffness that blocks out the daylight Morphing into primal  I'll cover every particle from there to Andromeda not forgetting a single location from the throat of Ibis to the co-ordinate of Matterhorn  My shot is genesis and catharsis Penetratonaut in a cosmology of lust  Suck this subterrenean creature out and show it proudly to the house of heaven With one slight wave of my hand star dissolves  Dissolve my brain Block my lungs I'll die from fever tomorrow when locked in sych a perfected now
egoism dictates human relations a world where fashion outshines morality here success is written in blood-red colours designed by the thirst for power  gather the faithful and propose a toast to the epoch of indifference  an all to ordinary story with aftertaste so bitter forced to be someone I don't want to be I'm losing myself. sinking deeper down I'm caught in the world wound web  a time represented by the void an excuse without content stuck in the abyss of existence with a content void of excuse  an all to ordinary story this is my story with an aftertaste so bitter  sinking deeper down I'm caught - I'm cage I'm gone
a sad song it was, through renewal it brought and a month seems sometimes shorter than a half nights longing  hidden and hard are the reasons for war polar twist, invert and flea  I can't dissolve this feeling of mine but patience will unlock the door and the maps of reasons re-written for me when the wait is over and the punishment is due each day I crawl to the hall of the giants  and I beg for mercy - and I beg for mercy in vein one night is a mare - two is worse How can I manage three?
I parish and nobody will know as my mouth remains still my heart awaits me. filled with gravel as the pain grows with each touch  since I marked her out from my tower reality focused through forbidden lenses she owns enough of preciousness a penalty given by the source  but I still have no choice through the hinderens freighten a labyrinth closing at the edge of space  but they never allow she's shut... for all beings but one I give, I scorn, I threat
Wipped in the eye by the sand Malicious have light of day obscured The sun has burned my skin Open wounds are licked by sand  To be punished by this vortex of scorn  Wrists and ankles are chained upon this land Drawn through the desert to be their sacrifice  So, this is my golgatha, so this is my grave The thieves, the liars, the hypocrit scum I'd slay them if only I could  The endless sand, the blackest land A cyclone of spinecrushing anger Meant for me  The overlords of the desert Not one was meant to be All human force now flee Rules of anatomy lost Rage into the extreme
April night-tyme And we run like muscles through the stagnant nodes of man Blood-bridges lean towards the gaping synapses to disarms the stars within us  Hornet Hive-dark Severed wings in vainless beating buzz out from inferno of fangs to disarms the stars within us  We should have been so much more by now Too dead inside to even know the guilt  Waning Ring-deep a halo of thorns Sips now down in the sheets of sharp silver to disarm the star within us
Rush faster on the one-way lane The answers so silent Rusty gods in their machine-mind armours Grind our souls in the millstone of time The deathbed harvest is a dead man's banquet of mould ridden bread and black, poisoned wine  And we go... our steps so silent And we go... our blooded trace The Jester Race  Calling our to the gathered masses Their answers so silent  And we go...  Embracing the tools of the neo-wolf age that speak of a silence and silence alone  Offering the tokens, the reliced idols To the heirs of the newly raped grounds Inferior even to the transparent winds Lesser in motion and sound  And we go...  There is no trace of me In their altered blueprints of life  Gaia impaled on their horns and lances The fumes from her body give chase As the throng of blind men savour the scent Dream-dead from Prosaic and hate  Epilogue  Sunwind strokes the ElectroHeart Ignition roars through the corridors Stream launching the binary vessels  Vanities in extreme formations Ride into tomorrow's rigid great face The machinery outlives the futile scripts of our dying jester race
the great word of blessendness and a feeling of ease a cup of the well of freedom and life we joyfully drink inside, all was new, but outwards nothing had changed  an escapade, then to the altar to evaluate all parts of the great mystery but all remains on the same spot, no signs of a new season  in my hand is a new word, but the word is still without a body a hidden life-stream that swells in the deep will soon give the word a 2nd face
I see then nightshade grow he spoke And southern hounds awoke at dawn Sought for the ever-liquid of our craving Caught by the all embracing nightly sun Admass - I laugh at your feeble lies - thrash  Hatred in my eyes and in my blood A scream across the fields - the rivers weep A vanquished lord upon an oaken throne Grief inside my flame grasp at my existence The seal of dawn is broken - fury  Wildfire  A windswept thought Out in the perimeter where laughs are No longer heard, screams no longer seen And life is always lost Gaze into the skies for they are blind Blinded by the nightshade of our lust Grinded to dust The wolves are here The beast of the savage lands They drink my blood They feast upon my remains The tears in their eyes betry  Wildfire
Raindrop hits the leaf changing it's position slightly on the street next to polls of monotonous waters He walks Slipping feet from steps at random He falls  In the space of between his body and the ground comets cast off their names stellar neurones misfire  Witnesses inhale the seed and spit out a million branches  Buds abloom in all directions frin which events occur relations and virused meetings catch fire and explode In the margin of butterfly wings entire cycles of evolution outplayed and faded sparked away and leaned back into vacuum-filled nirvana  Between the two of my eyes feverish fractal scar Dance like were they on drugs peyote labyrinth re-mapped exits A hasty blink and a million life-to-comes will never be the same as they never were  In the kinetic energy of a moving fist lies a birth-machine for a parallel universe  With the first movement in organic scap came a bouquet of alternative answers all different multiplied and re-divided  Coded in the spinal cord of a trilobite written between the legs on the Meganeura suburban city maps and dormant dictator semen marked their way through time
truth serves them embrace and defend her case part flattery, part threats for those who cling to this dominion will partake in its fall  with his silence, he passes the judgement over them with your feverish signs of force you'll make them and yourself to believe that he still retains his full power  as a platform for divine foundations, you want to make them suck  shallowness and beauty was all that concerned her body but the soul, her divine guest were thrust to the bottom  surrendered to the sect that has risen from its womb for those who cling to this dominion will partake in its fall
